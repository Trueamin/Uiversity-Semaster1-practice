# University Semester 1 Practice: Programming Fundamentals in C

This repository contains all the practical exercises, assignments, and mini-projects completed during the **First Semester** of the university's programming or computer science curriculum. The code is written primarily in **C**, focusing on mastering the foundational concepts of structured programming.

## üöÄ Key Topics Covered

The exercises demonstrate practical application of the core concepts taught in an introductory programming course. This collection is a showcase of proficiency in:

* **Basic Syntax and Data Types:** Variables, constants, and fundamental I/O operations.
* **Control Flow:** Mastery of conditional statements (`if/else`, `switch`) and looping structures (`for`, `while`).
* **Functions:** Defining and utilizing functions for modular and reusable code design.
* **Arrays and Strings:** Working with single- and multi-dimensional arrays, along with basic string manipulation.
* **Pointers (Introduction):** Fundamental concepts of memory addresses and pointer usage.
* **File Handling:** Simple examples of reading and writing data to local files.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized chronologically to reflect the weekly progression of the course curriculum, making it easy to track the gradual increase in project complexity.

| Folder | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `week1` | Introduction to C syntax, basic input/output, and simple calculations. |
| `week2` | Conditional logic and decision-making structures (`if/else`). |
| `week3` | Iterative control structures (`for`, `while` loops) and nested loops. |
| `week4` | Modular programming using Functions and parameter passing. |
| `week5` | Working with Single-dimensional Arrays and data processing. |
| `week6` | Multi-dimensional Arrays and String manipulation exercises. |
| `week7` | Basic examples of Pointers and/or more complex function applications. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Compile and Run the Code

All files are written in standard **C** and require a C compiler (such as **GCC** or Clang) to be executed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Trueamin/Uiversity-Semaster1-practice.git](https://github.com/Trueamin/Uiversity-Semaster1-practice.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the desired week's folder:**
    ```bash
    cd Uiversity-Semaster1-practice/week3
    ```
3.  **Compile the file (e.g., `exercise.c`):**
    ```bash
    gcc exercise.c -o exercise_program
    ```
4.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./exercise_program
    ```
